## Demonstration of CMS124v7

This incrementally develops a query implementing CMS124v7. For starters,
we'll have to import some dependencies.

    using JSON
    using Dates
    using DataKnots
    using DataKnots4FHIR
    using Pkg.Artifacts

Next let's build an in-memory database that holds our synthetic patient
bundles. Note that the downloaded data includes two additional bundles,
for providers and hospitals.

    datapath = joinpath(artifact"synthea-79", "synthea-79", "CMS124v7");

    function build(kind::String)
        items = []
        for fname in readdir(joinpath(datapath, kind))
            push!(items, JSON.parsefile(joinpath(datapath, kind, fname)))
        end
        return items
    end
    db = convert(DataKnot, (pass=build("numerator"),
                            fail=build("denominator")))

    @query db {no_pass=>count(pass), no_fail=>count(fail)}
    #=>
    │ no_pass  no_fail │
    ┼──────────────────┼
    │      10       10 │
