The DataKnots4FHIR.jl package will be released under the BuyLibre
license. This work is also released under an Evaluation License.

### BuyLibre License

So that we can build a commercially supported ecosystem of useful
applications and adapters surrounding the DataKnots platform, we will be
using BuyLibre (https://buylibre.org) cooperative licensing for vertical
market software components such as this one. BuyLibre is a collective
copyright licensing society, similar to ASCAP, cooperatively owned by
creators (see https://creators.coop). Under the BuyLibre license, our
intent is to recover costs, after which the given version will be
released under the MIT/Apache license. At this time, the BuyLibre
license is still under construction; individual commercial license to
use this work or a out-right "ransom" price to make this entire work
MIT/Apache can be obtained by emailing info@buylibre.org.
